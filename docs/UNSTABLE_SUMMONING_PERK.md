# UNSTABLE_SUMMONING Perk

## Overview
The `UNSTABLE_SUMMONING` perk is a passive perk that adds an element of unpredictability to conjuration spells. When a player with this perk summons a creature via a conjuration spell, there's a configurable chance that the summoned entity will transform into a completely different living entity from a predefined list.

## How It Works
- **Trigger**: Every time a conjuration spell summons a creature
- **Chance**: Configurable percentage chance (0.0 to 1.0) for the transformation to occur
- **Transformation**: The original summoned entity is replaced with a random entity from the configured list
- **Lifetime**: The transformed entity maintains the same lifetime as the original summon
- **No Drops**: Transformed entities drop no XP or items on death
- **Persistence**: Transformed entities are marked as persistent to prevent despawning

## Configuration

### Perk Type
```json
"perk": "PASSIVE_UNSTABLE_SUMMONING"
```

### Parameters
- **chance**: Float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability of transformation (e.g., 0.25 = 25% chance)
- **entities**: Array of entity registry names that the summon can transform into
- **isBuff**: Boolean indicating whether this is a beneficial perk (usually true)

### Example Configuration
```json
[
  {
    "perk": "PASSIVE_UNSTABLE_SUMMONING",
    "chance": 0.25,
    "entities": [
      "minecraft:zombie",
      "minecraft:skeleton",
      "minecraft:creeper",
      "minecraft:spider",
      "minecraft:enderman"
    ],
    "isBuff": true
  }
]
```

## Entity Registry Names
Common entity registry names you can use:
- `minecraft:zombie` - Zombie
- `minecraft:skeleton` - Skeleton
- `minecraft:creeper` - Creeper
- `minecraft:spider` - Spider
- `minecraft:enderman` - Enderman
- `minecraft:blaze` - Blaze
- `minecraft:ghast` - Ghast
- `minecraft:slime` - Slime
- `minecraft:magma_cube` - Magma Cube
- `minecraft:guardian` - Guardian

## Placement
Place the configuration file in:
```
config/ars_affinity/perks/conjuration/[tier].json
```

Where `[tier]` is the level at which you want the perk to be available (e.g., `1.json`, `2.json`, `3.json`).

## Requirements
- Player must have the Conjuration school unlocked
- Player must have reached the required tier level
- The perk must be configured in the appropriate tier file

## Notes
- The transformation occurs immediately when the summon event fires
- The original entity is completely replaced, not modified
- Transformed entities are marked with a custom name "Unstable Summon" for identification
- The perk respects the original summon's lifetime settings
- Invalid entity types in the configuration will be logged as warnings
