# To Do
Let's make a mod! I have another mod already called Ars Mastery but we're abandoning it in favor of making a new one!
We'll start with the basics, so get the gitignore, build.gradle and other root files we need to get started!

- [x] Setup base java project with 'ars-affinity' as the package name
