2. **Potion of Water Affinity** - Increases Water school affinity by 10%
3. **Potion of Earth Affinity** - Increases Earth school affinity by 10%

## Crafting

All affinity potions are crafted using **Potion Brewing**:

- **Input**: Any mundane potion (minecraft:potion)
- **Ingredient**: The corresponding essence from Ars Nouveau
  - Fire Essence → Fire Affinity Potion
  - Water Essence → Water Affinity Potion
  - Earth Essence → Earth Affinity Potion
  - Air Essence → Air Affinity Potion
  - Abjuration Essence → Abjuration Affinity Potion
  - Anima Essence → Anima Affinity Potion
  - Conjuration Essence → Conjuration Affinity Potion
  - Manipulation Essence → Manipulation Affinity Potion

Simply place a mundane potion in the brewing stand, add the essence as the ingredient, and wait for the brewing to complete!

## Usage

Simply drink the potion to instantly increase your affinity towards that school of magic by 10%. The effect is permanent and stacks with other affinity changes from spell casting.

## Technical Details

- Each potion applies a 1-tick duration effect that triggers once when consumed
- Affinity increases are capped at 100% (1.0) per school
- The potions use the same color scheme as their respective magic schools
- All potions are beneficial effects and can be used in splash and lingering variants

## Code Architecture

The affinity potion effects are implemented using a superclass pattern to reduce code duplication:

- **AbstractAffinityIncreaseEffect**: Base class that handles all the common functionality
- **Individual Effect Classes**: Simple classes that only specify the school, name, and color
- **Package Structure**: All affinity effects are organized in `com.github.ars_affinity.potion.affinity_increase`

This approach makes it easy to add new affinity potions in the future by simply extending the superclass.

## Data Generation

All brewing recipes are automatically generated using Java datagen:

- **ArsAffinityBrewingDataGen**: Generates brewing recipe JSON files for all 8 affinity potions
- **Automatic**: Recipes are generated when running `./gradlew runData`
- **Consistent**: All recipes follow the same pattern and are guaranteed to be valid
- **Maintainable**: No need to manually create or maintain JSON recipe files

## Recipe Examples

### Fire Affinity Potion
```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:brewing",
  "ingredient": {
    "item": "ars_nouveau:fire_essence"
  },
  "input": {
    "item": "minecraft:potion"
  },
  "output": {
    "item": "ars_affinity:fire_affinity"
  }
}
```

*Note: This recipe is automatically generated by the datagen system.*

## Notes

- These potions provide a way to quickly boost specific school affinities without extensive spell casting
- Useful for players who want to specialize in particular schools early on
- The 10% increase is significant enough to be useful but not overpowered
- All recipes use vanilla brewing mechanics, making them accessible to new players
- Brewing recipes are automatically generated, ensuring consistency and maintainability
